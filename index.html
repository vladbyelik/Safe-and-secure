                        With safety and security always priority one, John Wayne Airport (JWA) continues its steadfast
                        commitment to meet or exceed all federally mandated security regulations. Our goal is simple to
                        maintain a safe environment for our guests, aviation partners, tenants, employees, and
                        volunteers. During 2015, our unwavering dedication continued through close partnerships with the
                        Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S.
                        Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Airport Police Services (Orange County Sheriff's
                        Department) and Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (Orange County Fire Authority).

                        To meet stringent FAA safety requirements, JWA undergoes annual Part 139 inspections. In
                        January, JWA once again passed this comprehensive inspection, which included a
                        timed-response drill, live-fire drill, and thorough inspection of equipment, fueling facilities,
                        runways/taxiways and more.

                In May, JWA conducted its annual Aviation Security (AVSEC) Plan Review and Tabletop Exercise. During
                this TSA-mandated event, JWA air carries, major tenants and law enforcement
                partners gathered to review the current Airport Security Plan, the newest regulations and requirements,
                and to test specific aspects of the plan through a tabletop exercise.
